// Add selectable keyboard/joypad movement to GameObjects

// Add motion to the GameObjects
- x,y,dx,dy,speed,acceleration
- animation frames -> luxury feature

// Ability to merge objects together

// Highlight GameObjects upon selection from dev.app.EditorWindow

// Undo/redo function - partially implemented. works on the editor window. Still does work for changes in the GameObectAttributed Panel

** code repetition in dev.app.EditorWindow. repetition of code in createShape and drawSelector when in snap mode
