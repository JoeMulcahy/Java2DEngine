Hello!

This is my first Java repo on GITHUB
I've been working on a java based 2d game editor that started off as an exercise on getting familiar with the Java Swing library for creating GUIs
Its still early days but I'm having a lot of fun coding!

The end goal of this project is to create a 2d game designer program that can create basic 2d games. Think pong and breakout

As of 06/10/2023
I have created basic shapes that can be drawn on a JPanel component. I've also implemented a grid so that shapes can snapped into position.
